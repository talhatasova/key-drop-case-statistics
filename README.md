This repository is shared publicly for the sake of gamblers who want to make "better" decisions while gambling on key-drop.com. All data belong to key-drop.com and is up-to-date as much as it is on the website. Use the presented data here ***AT YOUR OWN RISK and AVOID GAMBLING*** at all costs.

# How should you read the plots?
  - X-Axis: Probability (Odds in real numbers between 1-100000)
  * Y-Axis: Price
  + Title: "pay-off percentage rate"-"name of the case" (the comma used as a decimal point separator is replaced by an underscore).
- The plots show the content of JOKER cases. The horizontal green line shows you the price of that case so that you can take it as a reference point to set the point where you start making profit. The prices of the items that are higher than that of case are shown on the plot. Each item is represented as a horizontal line where the length represents the probability of that item to come out of the case.

# How recent is the data?

# Where is the data? - Why are the plots not in GitHub? - How can I access the rest of the plots?
Simply because GitHub is not a place to store hundreds of megabytes of images. Instead, they are kept at Google Drive:

# What To Do and What NOT To Do
- [ ] Look at the plots, think that they will get your money doubled, gamble based on misinterpreted information out of them.
- [x] Look at the plots, realise the differences between cases, see this as a fun project about statistics, NOT gamble your money.
